# Line Drawing Algorithms
This repository contains a custom implementation (in C) of the following line drawing algorithms:

- Digital Differential Analyser 
- Bresenham
- Midpoint (Integer and Float versions)

**I didnt use any graphics library. The visualisation is made through the standard command line with characters representing the pixels.**
